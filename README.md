AO3 Toys is a browser extension (Chrome and Firefox) that adds tag highlighting, work filtering, theming, and a better reading view on top of AO3 — entirely client-side. Nothing you configure ever leaves your browser.

## Features

- **Tag Highlighting** — Give any tag a color so it stands out in listings, or fade and hide the ones you're tired of seeing. Hover a tag anywhere on AO3 and click the dot (or right-click the tag) to configure it on the spot; synonyms are matched automatically.
- **Regex Tags** — Match whole families of tags with one pattern, so you can highlight or hide every variant without chasing each spelling by hand.
- **Work Hiding** — Collapse or remove works by excluded tags, language, or crossover count. Each filter can be set to don't hide, collapse to a banner, or remove entirely, and a master switch shows everything again without losing your setup.
- **Theme** — A full dark theme for AO3 with accent colors and an OLED mode, shown in a live preview as you tweak it.
- **Work Listings** — Shape what every work blurb shows: colored date badges, "Completed" labels, extra stats like kudos-per-hit, and tag cleanup.
- **Reading History** — Remembers which works you've visited and how far you got: chapter progress on work pages, visited/subscribed badges and fresh-chapter alerts in listings, an ignore button, and a "pick up where you left off" prompt that returns you to the exact paragraph.
- **Reading Settings** — A reader panel on every work page for font, size, width, line height, and paragraph spacing, plus a "standardize line breaks" option for works with stray empty lines between paragraphs.
- **Quick Toggles** — The toolbar popup gives you quick switches for the big features, perfect for turning all hiding off for a browse and back on afterwards.
- **Import / Export** — Back up your tags and settings, or move them to another browser, since everything lives locally.

Works on `archiveofourown.org` and its known mirrors/aliases.

## Installation

AO3 Toys isn't on the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons yet, so for now it's installed from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Eden7600/ao3-toys/releases/latest), which has a ready-to-use build for each browser.

### Chrome, Edge, Brave, and other Chromium browsers

1. Download `ao3-toys-chrome-vX.Y.Z.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Eden7600/ao3-toys/releases/latest) and unzip it somewhere you'll keep it (deleting the folder later disables the extension).
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` (or your browser's equivalent extensions page).
3. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder.

The extension updates when you repeat these steps with a newer release; it won't auto-update on its own.

### Firefox

Firefox only runs unsigned extensions permanently in Nightly/Developer Edition with signature checks disabled, so the straightforward path is a temporary install (reloaded each time Firefox restarts):

1. Download `ao3-toys-firefox-vX.Y.Z.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Eden7600/ao3-toys/releases/latest) and unzip it.
2. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on…** and select the `manifest.json` inside the unzipped folder.

If you're on Firefox Nightly or Developer Edition and want a persistent install, you can instead set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` in `about:config` and install the zip directly.

### Building it yourself

See [Development](#development) below to build from source instead.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (the version pinned in `package.json`'s `packageManager` field; `corepack enable` will pick it up automatically)

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Eden7600/ao3-toys.git
cd ao3-toys
pnpm install
```

### Common scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm build:dev:chrome` | Build an unpacked dev build for Chrome into `dist/chrome` |
| `pnpm build:dev:firefox` | Build an unpacked dev build for Firefox into `dist/firefox` |
| `pnpm build:dev` | Build dev builds for both browsers |
| `pnpm build` | Build production builds for both browsers |
| `pnpm test` | Run the unit test suite (Vitest) |
| `pnpm types` | Type-check the project (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| `pnpm lint` | Lint the project (ESLint) |

After building, load the appropriate `dist/<browser>` folder as an unpacked/temporary extension using the same steps as [Installation](#installation), pointed at your local build instead of a downloaded release. Rebuild and reload the extension after each change — there's no hot reload for the extension itself.

### Tech stack

- **TypeScript**, built with **Vite**
- **Vue 3** for the options page and popup, **Preact** for in-page (content script) UI
- **Tailwind CSS** + **PrimeVue** for styling and components
- **Dexie** (IndexedDB) for local storage
- **Vitest** for unit tests, **ESLint** + **Prettier** for linting/formatting

## Privacy

AO3 Toys does not collect, transmit, or sell any data. All settings, tags, and reading history are stored locally in your browser via extension storage. The `Import / Export` screen lets you back up or move that data yourself.
