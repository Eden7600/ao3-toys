AO3 Toybox is a browser extension (Chrome and Firefox) that adds tag highlighting, work filtering, theming, and a better reading view on top of AO3.

## Features

- **Tag Highlighting** — Give any tag a color so it stands out in listings, or fade and hide the ones you're tired of seeing. Hover a tag anywhere on AO3 and click the dot (or right-click the tag) to configure it on the spot; synonyms are matched automatically.
- **Regex Tags** — Match whole families of tags with one pattern, so you can highlight or hide every variant without chasing each spelling by hand.
- **Work Hiding** — Collapse or remove works by excluded tags, language, crossover count, word count, kudos/hits ratio, words per chapter, podfic, or how much of them you've already read. Each filter can be set to don't hide, collapse to a banner, or remove entirely, and a master switch shows everything again without losing your setup.
- **Theme** — A full dark theme for AO3 in two families: classic accent colors with an OLED mode, or the complete Catppuccin palette in all four flavors — shown in a live preview as you tweak it. The popup and settings pages dress themselves to match.
- **Work Listings** — Shape what every work blurb shows: colored date badges, "Completed" labels, extra stats like kudos-per-hit, and tag cleanup.
- **Reading Times** — Reading-time and "finish at" stats on listings and above each chapter, driven by your reading speed (measure it with the built-in speed test). Finish times keep themselves current while you browse.
- **Progress Bar** — A reading progress bar on any screen edge, with configurable thickness, fill style, curated colors, chapter markers, an optional percent / time-remaining label, and click-to-jump — measuring the whole work or just the current chapter, previewed live in the settings.
- **Reading History** — Remembers which works you've visited and how far you got: chapter progress on work pages, visited/subscribed badges and fresh-chapter alerts in listings, an ignore button, and a "pick up where you left off" prompt that returns you to the exact paragraph.
- **Reading Settings** — A reader panel on every work page for font, size, width, line height, and paragraph spacing, plus a "standardize line breaks" option for works with stray empty lines between paragraphs.
- **Quick Toggles** — The toolbar popup gives you quick switches for the big features, perfect for turning all hiding off for a browse and back on afterwards. Theme, hiding, highlighting, and reading-stat changes apply to open AO3 tabs instantly — no reload needed.
- **Import / Export** — Back up your tags and settings, or move them to another browser, since everything lives locally.

## Installation

### Firefox

Install it from [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ao3-toybox/) — updates arrive automatically.

### Chrome, Edge, Brave, and other Chromium browsers

Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ao3-toybox/kcdcffopbhkekgafpkpkicnbmamhlppc) — updates arrive automatically.

Prefer not to use a store? Each [release](https://github.com/Eden7600/ao3-toybox/releases/latest) ships ready-to-load zips for both browsers, and you can build from source and load your own build — see [Development](#development) below.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (the version pinned in `package.json`'s `packageManager` field; `corepack enable` will pick it up automatically)

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Eden7600/ao3-toybox.git
cd ao3-toybox
pnpm install
```

### Common scripts

| Command                  | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm build:dev:chrome`  | Build an unpacked dev build for Chrome into `dist/chrome`   |
| `pnpm build:dev:firefox` | Build an unpacked dev build for Firefox into `dist/firefox` |
| `pnpm build:dev`         | Build dev builds for both browsers                          |
| `pnpm build`             | Build production builds for both browsers                   |
| `pnpm test`              | Run the unit test suite (Vitest)                            |
| `pnpm types`             | Type-check the project (`tsc --noEmit`)                     |
| `pnpm lint`              | Lint the project (ESLint)                                   |

### Loading a development build

After building, load the appropriate `dist/<browser>` folder as an unpacked/temporary extension. Rebuild and reload the extension after each change — there's no hot reload for the extension itself.

**Chromium browsers:**

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` (or your browser's equivalent extensions page).
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select `dist/chrome`.

**Firefox** (temporary install, reloaded each time Firefox restarts):

1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on…** and select the `manifest.json` inside `dist/firefox`.

Regular Firefox only runs unsigned extensions temporarily; if you're on Firefox Nightly or Developer Edition and want a persistent install of your own build, set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` in `about:config` and install a zipped build directly.

### Tech stack

- **TypeScript**, built with **Vite**
- **Vue 3** for the options page and popup, **Preact** for in-page (content script) UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling, with in-house components built on **Reka UI** primitives
- **Dexie** (IndexedDB) for local storage
- **Vitest** for unit tests, **ESLint** + **Prettier** for linting/formatting

## Privacy

AO3 Toybox does not collect, transmit, or sell any data. All settings, tags, and reading history are stored locally in your browser via extension storage. The `Import / Export` screen lets you back up or move that data yourself.
